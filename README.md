1. solved 100 problems in last 25 days, mostly 800s and some 900s.(currently on <b>25 days streak</b>) - 22.08.24

2. solved <b>200 problems, total on CF</b>, mainly 800s, some 900s and from the Assiut Sheet, in this current account - 26.08.24

3. solve <b><ins>250</ins> problems, total on CF </b>, a lot of them were from Assiut Uni NewComers Contests. Nothing impressive - 13.09.24


## I'm not completely sure about it, but it feels like, AI will do heavy damage to the online problem solving competitions, as of now, with the release of latest OpenAI model. I think, for now, at least, I should focus more on my machine learning study, research activities, and some development works that I love. From now, maybe, give it a full focused time span of maybe, 4 to 6 months or so, then let's see what happens. I mean, I've missed the **GOLDEN PERIOD** of problem solving. But let's see, what happens, if CF remains alive, and maybe other opportunites come, like, more onsite competitions or so, I'll return as I'm really into algorithms and the art of problem solving. For now, let's take a sweet break from it. Unfortunate break, I would say. - 16.09.24
